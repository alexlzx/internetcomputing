Using DNSInitialQuery.bin as an example lookup, we made all of our
functions and extracted the right data (query ID, QR, AA, RCODE, all
counts, QNAME etc.). This data was saved into variable as seen in
DNSResponse.java. However, we could not successfully make a connection
to a DNS resolver with the given argument to do an actual lookup, so
nothing is printed when the program is run on a given lookup.  Our
understanding of the DNS query-response protocol was sufficient to do
most of the tasks in the assignment, but due to a time restraint we
were not able to make the program presentable.  Based on that, we
believe we deserve some part marks for extracting the fields from a
given DNS response, which was the bulk of the assignment.
